## Intro
Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience in Python application development. My expertise spans machine learning algorithms, and Iâ€™m skilled with libraries like LangChain, SciPy, and TensorFlow.

I excel in data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, and have a proven track record of building and deploying machine learning models in production. As a team player with strong communication and problem-solving skills, Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging machine learning to tackle real-world challenges.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect if youâ€™d like to collaborate!
